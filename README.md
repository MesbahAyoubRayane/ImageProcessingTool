# Image Processing Tool

## Description
This project implements various image transformation operations from scratch using NumPy. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and TtkBootstrap, allowing users to interactively apply transformations and segmentations on images. The project also includes K-means color segmentation, threshold-based segmentation, and contour detection.

## Features
- **Image Transformations:** Perform a variety of hard-coded transformations using NumPy.
- **K-means Color Segmentation:** Segment images based on color clusters.
- **Threshold-Based Segmentation:** Apply thresholding to segment images based on intensity values.
- **Contour Detection:** Detect and highlight contours in images.
- **Interactive GUI:** Built with Tkinter and TtkBootstrap for a modern look and user-friendly experience.
